#' z-score pupil timeseries data
#'
#' The intended use of this method is to scale the arbitrary units of the pupil
#' size timeseries to have a mean of `0` and a standard deviation of `1`. This
#' is accomplished by mean centering the data points and then dividing them by
#' their standard deviation (i.e., z-scoring the data, similar to
#' [base::scale()]). Opting to z-score your pupil data helps with trial-level
#' and between-subjects analyses where arbitrary units of pupil size recorded by
#' the tracker do not scale across participants, and therefore make analyses
#' that depend on data from more than one participant difficult to interpret.
#'
#' @details
#' In general, it is common to z-score pupil data within any given
#' participant, and furthermore, z-score that participant's data as a function
#' of block number (for tasks/experiments where participants complete more than
#' one block of trials) to account for potential time-on-task effects across
#' task/experiment blocks.
#'
#' As such, if you use the `eyeris` package as intended, you should NOT need
#' to specify any groups for the participant/block-level situations described
#' above. This is because `eyeris` is designed to preprocess a single block of
#' pupil data for a single participant, one at a time. Therefore, when you later
#' merge all of the preprocessed data from `eyeris`, each individual,
#' preprocessed block of data for each participant will have already been
#' independently scaled from the others.
#'
#' Additionally, if you intend to compare mean z-scored pupil size across task
#' conditions, such as that for memory successes vs. memory failures, then do
#' NOT set your behavioral outcome (i.e., success/failure) variable as a
#' grouping variable within your analysis. If you do, you will consequently
#' obtain a mean pupil size of 0 and standard deviation of 1 within each group
#' (since the scaled pupil size would be calculated on the timeseries from each
#' outcome variable group, separately). Instead, you should compute the z-score
#' on the entire pupil timeseries (before epoching the data), and then split and
#' take the mean of the z-scored timeseries as a function of condition variable.
